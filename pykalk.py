#This is a Python comment
#There are no { } blocks in Python.  Instead you space over
#4 spaces when you need to indicate a body.  Notice that I am
#defining a function called printout.  The definition ends with a :
#indicating that a code suite (you can think of it as a block) is
#coming up next.  I space each line in the suite over 4 spaces -- do
#not use a tab!  That can mess things up.  You have to be consistent
#in the number of spaces.  4 is what Guido von Rossum, Python's inventor
#uses as the de facto standard.
